v.0.5.72

***THE MOD WILL BE MOVING TO 1.20.6 FOR THE NEXT UPDATES OUTSIDE ANY MAJOR CRASHES***

## FIXES
- Fixes Adult Xenos always getting stuck, no longer uses fancy crawling system. Too many issues.
- Fixes being able to boat/minecart trap xenos.
- Fixes missing swimming sounds.

## NEW
- Villagers will now run from Xenos.

## CHANGES
- Fancy crawling mobs will swim better now.

Please note that Neos are still heavily WIP and not considered released until posted. This is why you can't find eggs in the creative menu without the config option.
No bug reports will be accepted for them until they have reached what we feel is release status ready.
