v.0.5.74

## FIXES
- Fixes Classic Xenos going sonic when on top of water.
- Fixes Xenos getting stuck in corners and on walls.

## NEW
- Ported to 1.20.6

## CHANGES
- Pathfinding tweaked, still heavily WIP and Xeno speeds are still being tweaked.
   - Xenos shouldn't be stopped by flowing water now.
   - Tweak done for going through holes.
- Removed BetterCrawling system, too many issues.
- Chestbursters don't use sound system anymore.


Please note that Neos are still heavily WIP and not considered released until posted. This is why you can't find eggs in the creative menu without the config option.
No bug reports will be accepted for them until they have reached what we feel is release status ready.
