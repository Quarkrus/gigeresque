v.0.5.69 (Nice ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) )

***THE MOD WILL BE MOVING TO 1.20.5 ONCE IT RELEASES AND 1.20.1 WILL BE SUNSET OUTSIDE ANY MAJOR CRASHES***

## FIXES
- Mixin crash at startup.
- Fixes mixin code for Black Goo not working correctly.

## NEW
- Acid now breaks faster or slower depending on the blocks hardness level if it's able to break it.

## CHANGES
- Acid is no longer a block but now an entity.
- Acid works faster now.
- Acid is placed randomly for larger entities now in a diameter.
- Acid no longer replaces a block when a xeno uses it to break blocks, instead spawning the acid in the block to break it.
- Black goo blood is no longer a block but now an entity.
- Black goo blood will apply it's effect faster now.
- Renamed the item tag from acidresistant to acidimmuneitems.

Please note that Neos are still heavily WIP and not considered released until posted. This is why you can't find eggs in the creative menu without the config option.
No bug reports will be accepted for them until they have reached what we feel is release status ready.
