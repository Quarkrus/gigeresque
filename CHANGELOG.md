v.0.5.70

***THE MOD WILL BE MOVING TO 1.20.5 ONCE IT RELEASES AND 1.20.1 WILL BE SUNSET OUTSIDE ANY MAJOR CRASHES***

## FIXES
- Fixes floating entities.
- Fixes huggers not swiming correctly.
- Fixes Eggs dropping acid on hits or death.

## NEW
- Added fade to black overlay when you are affected by Black Fluid

## CHANGES
- Acid combines when stacked.
- Black Fluid blood combines when stacked.

Please note that Neos are still heavily WIP and not considered released until posted. This is why you can't find eggs in the creative menu without the config option.
No bug reports will be accepted for them until they have reached what we feel is release status ready.
